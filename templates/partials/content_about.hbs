        <div class="content_box_about">
            <p>
                1. We believe the adoption of electric vehicles is key to a more eco-friendly and sustainable city.
                Electric vehicles can utilize renewable energy sources directly and they produce zero emissions compared
                to their gas powered counterparts.<br><br>
                2. To bring about the adoption of electric vehicles, we must address the pain points of owning an
                electric vehicle, such as charger availability and range anxiety. Our solution is to become the bridge
                between electric vehicle owners and home owners with private chargers.<br><br>
                3. We believe by monetizing private chargers utilizing a peer-to-peer sharing model, we can add
                thousands of charging points in our city without the need for the government to spend millions of
                dollars on centralized charging infrastructure.
