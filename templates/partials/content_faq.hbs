                Q. If I don't have a dedicated electric vehicle charger, can I still join the network to offer charging to users? <br>
                A. Absolutely! Anyone who can provide access to a wall outlet for vehicles can join the network as a charging point for users. Keep in mind wall outlet charging points generally have a lower cost per use and charging times are longer than a level 2 charger.
